<h3> Chapter 3 Analysis </h3>
<p>Many websites look nice but don’t actually convince people to buy anything. Visitors scroll past boring headlines, plain text, and weak buttons. Without the right words and structure, even a great product can go unnoticed. A website that doesn’t know how to tell a good story will quickly lose the attention of its visitors. This chapter teaches you how to make your website more persuasive using simple HTML tools. You’ll learn how to write strong headlines, add powerful images, and create links that encourage people to take action. With just a few smart changes, your website can start working like a real salesperson—getting attention, building trust, and helping you make more sales.</p>
