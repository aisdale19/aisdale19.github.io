  <h3>The Web as Today’s Main Street</h3>
  <p>The web is today’s Main Street because it’s where people go to find products, services, and information, just like they used to walk down a busy street to visit local shops. But instead of being limited to one town, the internet connects you to billions of people all over the world. Your website is like your store, your domain name is your street address, and your server is the warehouse that holds your products. When someone visits your site, it’s like they’re walking into your store. If your website is secure, fast, and easy to use, more people will trust it, just like they would trust a clean, well-run shop on Main Street. Being online gives you a chance to open your store to the whole world, not just the people nearby.</p>
